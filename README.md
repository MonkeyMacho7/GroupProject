To whom this may concern:
In order to navigate yourself through this Milestone 2, this readme will be your perfect guide.
First I wanted to list what the contents are on this project. First there is a Tests folder, this contains our UnitTest1 test codes.
Second, the UVSim folder contains our program.cs code which is where our code is for our program. to run this you will need to just hit run on visual studios. When you run this program
It will first ask you to enter the path to the file. You will need to put the correctly formatted path to the test1.txt or test2.txt that was provided for this project.
Depending on which text file you choose, it will then ask you to enter a value to store in a memory, you will put a number. Then it will ask for one more number, provide it to the console.
After hitting enter, for the example I did, for the test1.txt file, it will add the two numbers together and return the memory location 9 value. Follow the same steps if you would like to do the test2.txt
The other contents that we have added to this is our contributor which is a photo of the teamwork we did. We have the Group Milestone 2 PDF which is all of the meetings we held and our plans. 
Next there is a spreadsheet that is used to guide through the test cases that we did for each use case. And last is our User stories and use cases for this project.
